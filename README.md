# AI Video Editor Chatbot ðŸŽ¬ðŸ¤–

An advanced AI-powered chatbot that edits videos in real-time through natural language commands. Inspired by modern AI assistants like ChatGPT, this project aims to merge conversational AI with creative tools.

## Vision
Build a chatbot interface where users can:
- Trim, cut, and merge video clips
- Add subtitles, filters, transitions
- Generate social media reels from long videos
- Export to different formats â€” all by just typing commands

## Example Commands
- "Cut this video from 0:30 to 1:15"
- "Add subtitles from this script"
- "Make this clip 1080p and remove background noise"
- "Create an Instagram reel from this vlog"

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- OpenAI (or LLaMA / fine-tuned model)
- FFmpeg
- OpenCV
- Streamlit or Gradio for UI
- LangChain for command parsing

## Future Scope
- Voice-based editing
- Integration with cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Multi-language support

## Status
ðŸ§ª Research & idea planning phase
